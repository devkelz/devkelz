üåäüëã Hey there! My name is Dev_Kelz and I work on small projects like websites just for fun. I have developed for Hexamity, Chinobe, Bloxoria and quite a few more sandbox games ranging from the years 2021-2023. 
- I am for hire, just give me a DM on discord @ dev_kelz
- Will *not* respond to likely bullshit, only ping or DM for serious questions or to hire.
- P.S no i wont help code ur epic club sites
- am i overusing these bullets? :) <br> <br>

Over the pandemic when Covid was breaking out I taught myself how to script in terms of backend and frontend. I now create small projects still in 2024 and try to work my way up towards working for huge projects.
- I taught myself the languages **PHP**, **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and a few others in that time span. Thanks to Covid for actually giving me the time to work on my coding ability üëç
- This is also around the time that I owned my own sandbox sites and staffed for like 100 sandbox sites mostly Epic Club source LMFAO (although i appreciate those times because a lot of memories i am fond of still linger in my head today)

<h1>Some (mostly) useless facts about me:</h1> <br>
- I joined the site brick-hill.com in 2017, it was much more fun before the owner of Alexander Dunn got exposed as a pedophile. <br>
- I was the richest user and person with the most forum posts in Vistora (Old sandbox site from 2021. Very fun. Rip Vistora) <br>
- I have contributed to 200M+ visits on Roblox. <br>
- As of January 13th, 2024, I am locked out of my main Roblox acc lel <br>
- I have had over 2 years of Discord Nitro in total <br>
<br>
more soon idfk i put this together very quickly <br>
